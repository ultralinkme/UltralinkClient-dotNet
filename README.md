# .NET Ultralink Client API

This client library provides a simple and straightforward, object-oriented interface to an Ultralink Server. It abstracts away the specifics of interfacing with the REST API directly and lets you concentrate on accomplishing what you have set out to do.

Requires at least .NET 4.5.
